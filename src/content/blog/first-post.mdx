## Who am I?

I'm Brandon. If you'd like you can take a look at my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m_C_7SpOsX24g1VWxxJMQul7lKsVWQr4/view?usp=sharing) to see some stuff I've done.

TLDR:

- Hardware background in school/internships
- Google work all over the place (dist proc, systems/OS, apps, large scale distributed applications...same as most folks who hav worked there)
- Microsoft work in Windows
- Hobbies and code!
- Japanese speaker.

## What is this page for?

I have tons of thoughts and thought maybe I should write them down in case I forget or they might be useful to someone. Others do it for me and it's about time I do it for them.

This is also a front end playground for stuff when I feel like fiddling with that.

## Why blog?

Just to share thoughts and ideas, keep track of things I learned, get yelled at on the internet.

### Goals

Share, learn, love.

## Why Astro?

I can make a static site that is easy and doesn't require a database or CMS,
experiment with various front end technologies, and write in markdown to get
stuff out easily (after setting up styles one time I hope).

### Experimentation

can embed various frameworks, can write experiment code or code to make a point.

#### Example

Here's a timer I--like--just threw together right now (I am NOT a front end dev,
so I did consult the docs and chatGPT).

import CodeBlock from "../../components/CodeBlock.astro";

<CodeBlock filename="src/components/demos/solid/timer.tsx" lang="tsx" />

import { Timer } from "../../components/demos/solid/timer";

<div class="pb-2">
  <Timer client:only="solid-js" />
</div>

### MDX

can write most of the blog posts (like this one!) in simple MD(X)

### Goals

### Non Goals

## Why Astro?

### Experimentation

can embed various frameworks, can write experiemnt code or code to make a point.

#### Example

Here's a timer I--like--just threw together right now (I am NOT a front end dev,
so I did consult the docs and chatGPT).

import CodeBlock from "../../components/CodeBlock.astro";

<CodeBlock filename="src/components/demos/solid/timer.tsx" lang="tsx" />

import { Timer } from "../../components/demos/solid/timer";

<div class="pb-2">
  <Timer client:load />
</div>

### MDX

can write most of the blog posts (like this one!) in simple MD(X)

# Building Blind

Recently I've been using chat GPT (among other AI tools) quite a bit in order to
get the ball rolling on a [few personal
projects](https://github.com/brandonpollack23/matchmaker-rs). I will post more
about matchmaker-rs (and the later implementation to be made, matchmaker-ex in
elixir) soon, but first I wanted to talk a bit about this pair coding with AI.

## Motivation

I have a few close friends that are very skeptical of AI and its potential, they
generally give me a shrug and say things like "It just seems like a gimmick" or
"I just don't see how it can really help me day to day in my work".

I can see where they are coming from (and about a year ago, I was with them!),
but I've been playing more and more with this stuff, have close friends in the
industry, and I am confident in this:

> **We cannot ignore these tools anymore. Get with it or you may be _left behind_.**

![A gif of Keanu Reaves saying "whoa"](/keanu-whoa.gif)

Whoa. That's a bold (crazy!?) claim. But I believe it and I intend to back it up with this post.

## What we'll build

Let's build something blind in a framework I like and have read some about but have never really used.

I am telling you the truth. I know roughly how I'll build this, but I haven't
ever really used SolidJS. Take any framework you are interested in but don't
know much about and follow along with me. I am going to use chatGPT to help me
build a calculator widget in SolidJS with typescript.

If you've read my [first post](/blog/first-post.html) you know this blog is
built with Astro, and so I can embed components from any framework.

## Final note on using ChatGPT

I don't believe chatGPT or bard or any other AI is a replacement for an engineer.

The point I'm trying to make here is simply this:

I know SolidJS _somewhat_. I've used other frameworks similar, I've used it once
before, I've read through docs, I've thought about problems in the shower...but
I've never really built anything with it bigger than a couple of components. In
order to use it, I'd have to heavily reference examples and documentation.

ChatGPT saves me this hassle. It's not a replacement for an engineer, but it
compresses all the information I need and saves me time and effort searching,
keeping me fresh.

**_It is a companion to the documentation, not a replacement._**

# The start of a calculator

Ok so I'm not totally helpless, but I'm going to be lazy and just go from teh
start and get some scaffolding in straight away to avoid having to brush up on
the docs. Now my friends (one in particular this article is targeted towards)
will be the first to tell you and make fun of me for **_Loving_** documentation
(all you have to do is read the manual!), but I've come to their way of thinking
somewhat. IFF you can execute and get the job done quickly without reading the
manual, shoudln't you sometimes?

## GPT Alone

Now, chatGPT is good enough to do this entire component all by itself I reckon,
and you can do this, cross reference the docs, and be done.

But that's not my intent here. My intent is to show how one might use this tool
on something larger and more complex. So I'm going to use chatGPT to help me
get the scaffolding in place, and then build on that bit by bit. But in case
you wanna know what chat GPT comes up with:

import CodeBlockSubtitled from "/src/components/CodeBlockSubtitled.astro";

<CodeBlockSubtitled
  filename="src/components/demos/solid/building_a_calculator/calculator_gpt0.tsx"
  lang="tsx"
>
  <p>
    "GPT4 Prompt: I want to make a simple calculator component in solidJS, can you build that for
    me? It should have addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and clear functionality"
    <br />
    Link: <a href="https://chat.openai.com/share/5f1737f0-6c04-4d2b-a417-3fab2821bc48">ChatGPT</a>
  </p>
</CodeBlockSubtitled>

This is nearly right, there is just a missing conversion, some padding, and the
input is text (I wanted to build one with buttons). But I didn't specify that.

```tsx
const add = () => setResult(parseFloat(input1()) + parseFloat(input2()).toString());
// etc...
```

<br />

Here it is all fixed up with a bit of styling added to help out:

import CalculatorGpt1 from "/src/components/demos/solid/building_a_calculator/calculator_gpt1.tsx";

<div class="p-2 rounded-md border-gray-200 border-2 shadow-md text-center">
  <CalculatorGpt1 client:only="solid-js" />
</div>

Well wasn't that simple!

## Ok but for real

Ok yeah sure. Real stuff is harder and more complex. So let's treat this problem like a series of harder problems.

Here are a set of new requirements:

- I want all those operations listed
- I want to find a square root using [Newton's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method)
- I want everything to be a button, not typing number inputs

<br />

Let's go!

# Starting with a button

I'm using tailwind and that is set up for me. Imagine you're working at a
company and some other smart engineer already did all that. You're simply told
"make this thing in this way we make things ok go kthxbie".

Alright...better start with just a button. I'm going to use chatGPT to help me.

<CodeBlockSubtitled
  filename="src/components/demos/solid/building_a_calculator/calculator0.tsx"
  lang="tsx"
>
  <p>
    ChatGPT prompt: I'm building a calculator in solidJS. I already have tailwindCSS setup and want
    to use that. Let's go slowly one step at a time. First I don't want text input I want to use
    button input. Can you help me make the buttons? I want them to have a flat style with rounded
    cornerned rectangles. Lets start with just the button part.
    <br />

  </p>
</CodeBlockSubtitled>

Whoa! ChatGPT went pretty hard, it generated more than just the button I asked for,
anticipating my next questions and building the grid and everything (you can see that in the link).

Let's just look at this button, though.

import Calculator0 from "/src/components/demos/solid/building_a_calculator/calculator0.tsx";

<div class="p-2 m-2 rounded-md border-gray-200 border-2 shadow-md text-center">
  <Calculator0 label="button" />
</div>

<br />

Can't I just say? Wow.

> Wow.

import { WowButton } from "/src/components/demos/solid/building_a_calculator/calculator0.tsx";

<div class="p-2 m-2 rounded-md border-gray-200 border-2 shadow-md text-center">
  <WowButton client:only="solid-js" />
</div>

Not only did it make a nice button it did a ton of nice things I need but forgot to ask for:

- It made the button have a hover effect
- It added event handling
- It added arbitrary labeling
- It handled unset onClick handlers.

It did make a "mistake" in that this is not valid strict typescript since the props have no type.

It also oddly (to me but perhaps I don't know some idiom) seperated the callback
from the data by also passing a "value" prop. I suppose this is nice if you want
to change payload but not reload different callbacks etc in the application.

## Fixing the errors.

ChatGPT forgot to be type safe, probably because most folks don't. I'll just fix
that up really quick by defining the interface (I could have asked ChatGPT to do
this for me if I don't know typescript so well, but that's ok)

import CodeBlock from "/src/components/CodeBlock.astro";

<CodeBlock filename="src/components/demos/solid/building_a_calculator/calculator1.tsx" lang="tsx" />

_Juicy_. Nice and safe. Thanks types!

## Constructing the grid

Well, chatGPT already did that, so let's show what that looks like now.

I've also added a bit of cleanup for typing as before and some renaming to make
it fit with what we have so far.

If you open the chat, you'll see at first it uses some stringly typing...ick.

I don't want to type a bunch of boilerplate, so maybe chatGPT can help me save some finger strokes.

<CodeBlock
  filename="src/components/demos/solid/building_a_calculator/calculator_button_type.tsx"
  lang="tsx"
/>

import Grid from "/src/components/demos/solid/building_a_calculator/calculator1.tsx";

<CodeBlockSubtitled

    "Followup prompt: can you generate buttons for 0-9, decimal point, addition, subtraction,
    division, multiplaction, positive negative, and equals?"
  </p>
  <p>"Great! Instead of stringly typed "value" prop can we use an enum or something type safe?"</p>
  <p>"can you save me some keystrokes and define the entire grid for me?"</p>

</CodeBlockSubtitled>

import CalculatorGrid from "/src/components/demos/solid/building_a_calculator/calculator2.tsx";

<div class="p-2 m-2 rounded-md border-gray-200 border-2 shadow-md text-center">
  <CalculatorGrid client:only="solid-js" />
</div>

![Are you not entertained gif](/are-you-not-entertained.gif)

Are you impressed yet?

It even put the things in the right order so the higher numbers are at the top,
operators on the right, things aren't just strewn about!

## Summary so far

Just to be clear, so far I've built a simple text input calculator, made a nice
pretty button (and I barely know CSS...I'm an OS and distributed systems
developer. I make tools. Any front end I've done is a hobby thing and it is
_BAD_).

So now what we need is an output box and to wire up the buttons to do things.

## Wiring up the buttons

Ok so as before, I've added some types and rearranged things a bit. I am the
engineer after all, GPT just helps me out.

I forget how to use `useState` in SolidJS, I'm glad it generated that for me. I
checked the Solid docs to make sure this all checks out. _Evvverrrythinnngg looks Gucci..._

<CodeBlockSubtitled
  filename="src/components/demos/solid/building_a_calculator/calculator_wired.tsx"
  lang="tsx"
>
  <p>
    "Now can we wire up the buttons to create numbers and state so that when I click them I can make
    a number, then I can click operations and make another number, and then I can click teh equals
    button and the final result is displayed?"
  </p>
</CodeBlockSubtitled>

### Aside

This ain't how I'd structure this. I'd decouple my state. Hard. But this is just a demo, I'm making a point here.

I'd probably have a stateless module that does the calculations, hide that
behind some opaque whatever if I needed to, then pass that (via props or [other
mechanisms](https://docs.solidjs.com/concepts/context) to my widget here.) Heck,
I could ask chatGPT to help with that too, but this has already taken me too
long to write and you wanna go on with your day (or [whatever it is you might be
doing](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/boss-makes-a-dollar-i-make-a-dime)).

I don't love this structure either. But it's a start. I can refactor later.

Chill out. Back to the code.

import CalculatorWired from "/src/components/demos/solid/building_a_calculator/calculator_wired.tsx";

<div class="p-2 m-2 rounded-md border-gray-200 border-2 shadow-md text-center">
  <CalculatorWired client:only="solid-js" />
</div>

Hey this is nice! There are some problems though:

- It jumps around because there is no minimum height set on the output box
- There is no clear button.
- The pos/neg button doesn't work right.
- After creating an output on equals it doesn't clear on the next input.
- Probably other stuff I haven't thought of yet.

But it is functional. I can work from here on my own quite easily and consult
the AI when I get stuck.

Here is one more with some fixes added. To keep the article itself short, I left
it out but you can see it in the blog's github under `calculator_wired2.tsx`.

import CalculatorWired2 from "/src/components/demos/solid/building_a_calculator/calculator_wired2.tsx";

<div class="p-2 m-2 rounded-md border-gray-200 border-2 shadow-md text-center">
  <CalculatorWired2 client:only="solid-js" />
</div>

Here is the diff:

<div>
  <CodeBlock
    class="language-diff-typescript diff-highlight"
    filename="public/building_blind/calculator_wired_diff.diff"
    type="tsx"
  />
</div>

# Conclusion

So hopefully this has begun to convince you, that this tool is useful. This
example is contrived but the long short is, GPT is great as a shortcut to the
docs.

I know I know. "But Brandon this is just a calculator toy". Yeah it is, but I've
used it for more complex things! But don't just take my word for it, try it
yourself! Try GPT4 or Gemini Ultra Pro Ultimate Edition with extras formerly known as Bard (or whatever
they're calling it now...). Code with it, try asking it questions instead of
digging deep in docs. See what it says.

If you require more evidence, my most recent project that is the subject of an
upcoming post,
[matchmaker-rs](https://github.com/brandonpollack23/matchmaker-rs), a toy game
match maker (that does nothing) utilized this technique a lot. I had never
really integrated `tokio_tracing`, all those different subscribers for it, made
my own protocol with serde (usually just use something that exists), or tons of
other things. But I used chatGPT to help me get started and it was a huge boon
to me, and I have ~10 years of experience. I like to think I'm not half bad sometimes.

I like to use it as a doc plus internet compressed search. It gets me going
quickly when I don't want to spend tons of time not coding.

Of course, grain of salt, this isn't an engineer, and you require context and
experience that you bring to the table. But it's a great tool to have in your arsenal.

_Ignore it at your peril._
